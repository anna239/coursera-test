                Mary van Kleeck (1883–1972) was an American social scientist and social feminist who advocated for
                scientific management and a planned economy. She began her career in the settlement movement,
                investigating
                women's labor in New York City. In 1916 she became the director of the Russell Sage Foundation's
                Department
                of Industrial Studies, which she led for over 30 years. During World War I, she was appointed by U.S.
                president Woodrow Wilson to lead the development of workplace standards for women entering the labor
                force.
                After the war, she led the creation of the Women's Bureau, a federal agency that advocates for women in
                the
                workforce.
